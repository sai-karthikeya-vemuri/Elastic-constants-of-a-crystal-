# Elastic-constants-of-a-crystal

    This function calculates the Elastic modulus of a crystal in any arbitrary crystallographic direction

    Input -- 
    C - an array of Elastic constants of single crystal in the order of C11,C22,C44
    direction- an array of size 3 which specifies the direction along which we want the Elastic Modulus
    Output --
    Elastic modulus in the given direction in GPa
